Bugs to Fix:

- The big blind should have the opportunity to check or raise even if no one raises beyond the big blind
- In the case that two players have a card with the same face value that combines with the same 4 table cards to make a highest hand of equal value, it seems to be going to the second player card to determine the winner (if so, this is wrong and should be a tie)

- Perhaps make someone go 'all in' instead of sit out when they don't have enough for the big blind
